DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script defines the Gold layer views in our data warehouse. 
    - The Gold layer is where we transform raw data into a business-friendly format.
    - It simplifies reporting and makes data easier for analysts to work with.
    - We take cleaned and structured data from the Silver layer and turn it into
      dimensions and fact tables, following a Star Schema.

Usage:
    - These views will be used directly for dashboards, reports, and analytics.

-- Creating the Customer Dimension Table (gold.dim_customers)
-- This view provides a clean, structured representation of customer data. 
-- A view is like a virtual table that doesnâ€™t store data itself but organizes and presents data 
-- from multiple tables in a structured way, making it easier to query and analyze.
-- It assigns a surrogate key for easy joins and enriches data by combining 
-- information from multiple Silver tables.
